Many individuals struggle with productivity not because they lack motivation, but because they experience decision fatigue when managing multiple tasks.
Existing productivity tools:
 - Present long task lists
 - Require constant manual prioritization
 - Overwhelm users with too many options
As a result, users delay action despite knowing what needs to be done.
Core Problem:
Users are unable to easily identify what task they should work on next.
